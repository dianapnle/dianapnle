## Hi there I'm Diana Le ðŸ‘‹

I currently am in San Diego, California.

I am a recent App Academy graduate. I am interested in making life easier by creating useful tools. I am equally passionate in learning new technologies in order to add skills to projects that I work on. I balance code with dancing ðŸ’ƒ, finding good food places ðŸ¥˜, and playing video games ðŸŽ®. 


## A little bit more about me...
