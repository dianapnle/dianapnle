## Hi there 👋 I'm Diana Le 

I currently am in San Diego, California.

I am a Full Stack Developer who recently graduated from App Academy 👩‍💻. I am interested in making life easier by creating useful tools. I am equally passionate in learning new technologies in order to add skills to projects that I work on. I balance code with dancing 💃, finding good food places 🥘, and playing video games 🎮. 


## A little bit more about me...
